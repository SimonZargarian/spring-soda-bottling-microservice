# Spring Soda Bottling Microservice Application

A Java, Spring based microservice application that represents structured interactions between services. 

## Description

Soda Bottling Microservice Application is a Java and Spring-based microservices architecture designed to simulate the operations of a soda bottling plant. This project demonstrates structured interactions between services in a production-like environment, illustrating the coordination required for effective microservice communication and management.

### Key Features:
* Microservice Architecture: Implements a series of independent microservices each handling a specific part of the soda bottling process, such as inventory management, order processing, and shipping.
* Service Interaction: Utilizes Spring Cloud for managing service discovery, configuration, and routing, enabling seamless interactions between the microservices.
* Distributed Data Management: Integrates Spring Data for handling distributed data across services, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
* Fault Tolerance: Employs resilience patterns like circuit breakers and fallback methods with Resilience4j, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service availability.
* Real-Time Monitoring: Incorporates Spring Boot Admin for monitoring the health and performance of all microservices, providing insights into the system's operational status.

This application serves as a example for developers looking to understand and implement a microservice architecture in a controlled, yet complex, scenario.
